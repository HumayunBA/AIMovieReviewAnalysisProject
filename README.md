# AIMovieReviewAnalysisProject

Problem Description:

I will focus on analyzing movie reviews to determine their sentiment, aiming to classify them as positive or negative. By using machine learning techniques, I aim to develop a model capable of accurately identifying the sentiment expressed in these reviews.

Data Collection and Analysis:

I will collect a dataset of movie reviews along with their sentiment labels (positive or negative). The IMDb dataset will be my primary source, but I will also explore other datasets like Amazon Reviews and Yelp Reviews to ensure a comprehensive analysis.

Using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy, I will analyze the dataset to understand its structure, quality, and any potential issues. Additionally, I will preprocess the data to handle missing values and convert the text into a suitable format for analysis.

Type of Problem:

This is a classification problem where I aim to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their sentiment. To train the model effectively, I will need labeled data where each review is associated with its corresponding sentiment label.

Future Considerations:

For the sentiment analysis task, I am considering the use of deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). I will explore various architectures and fine-tuning methods to improve the model's performance.

Furthermore, I will investigate different training platforms and resources such as TensorFlow and PyTorch to ensure efficient model training and deployment.

Documentation:

This document outlines Step 1 of my project, focusing on the problem description, data collection and analysis, type of problem, and future considerations. Coding in Python and the code base will be uploaded as well as the instruction to test and use it will be uploaded in this repository in the step 2.
